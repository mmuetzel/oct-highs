Title: High performance serial and parallel solver for large scale sparse linear optimization problems.
Description: HiGHS is a high performance serial and parallel solver for
 large scale sparse linear optimization problems of the form:
    Minimize (1/2) x^TQx + c^Tx subject to L <= Ax <= U; l <= x <= u
 where Q must be positive semi-definite and, if Q is zero, there may be a
 requirement that some of the variables take integer values.
